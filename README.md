🖥 Backend: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, JWT
💾 Database: MongoDB (Atlas or local)
☁ Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend), 
MongoDB Atlas (database)

📥SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1️⃣PREREQUISITES:
Make sure you have:

📦 Node.js (>= 18.x) → Download from nodejs.org
📦 npm (comes with Node.js)
🗄 MongoDB: Install MongoDB Community Edition 
(https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

verify installation using:
node -v
npm -v

A successful installation would output version of 
node and npm.

Now, after installing node, proceed to the following.

2️⃣ CLONE THE REPOSITORY
Open terminal and Clone the repository:
>> git clone https://github.com/SibaPrasadSahu/Slack-Connect-for-Cobalt.ai.git
>> cd Slack-Connect-for-Cobalt.ai

3️⃣ SLACK APP SETUP

1. Go to Slack API - Your Apps
2. Click Create New App → From Scratch
3. Now under OAuth & Permissions:

a. Put the Redirect URL (for local dev) as:
http://localhost:4000/api/auth/callback

b. Set up Scopes (User Token):
chat:write
chat:write.public
channels:read
channels:history
groups:read

4. Install the app to your workspace.

5. Copy:
- Client ID
- Client Secret
Both will these be then put to the .env file

4️⃣ BACKEND SETUP

1. Open terminal and go into backend folder:
>> cd backend
>> npm install

This will install all the dependencies.

2. Make the .env file in /backend:

PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/slack_scheduler
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_string
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_slack_client_id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_slack_client_secret
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_slack_signing_secret
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:4000/api/auth/callback
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
SCHEDULER_POLL_MS=3000

Next, delete the .env.example file as you made the environment variables.

3. Start Backend:
>> npm run dev

Leave the current terminal as it is and open a new terminal.
In this current terminal backend is running.

5️⃣ FRONTEND SETUP

1. Go into the front end folder
>> npm install

2. Create .env file in the front end folder and add
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000

After that delte the .env.example file as you've added the .env file.
3. Start Front End:
npm run dev

Leave this terminal running. This is where the front end 
is hosted.

6️⃣ RUNNING THE APPLICATION

Open a new tab in browser and paste the link for front end.
http://localhost:5173

Now, you have slack scheduler running.

🏗 Architectural Overview
🔐 OAuth Flow
   • 🖱 User clicks “Sign in with Slack” → Redirects to Slack OAuth page
   • 📩 Slack sends an authorization code to backend endpoint: /api/auth/callback
   • 🔄 Backend exchanges the code for an access token & stores it securely in MongoDB
   • 🍪 Sets a JWT session cookie in the browser for authentication

🔑 Token Management
   • 🗂 Tokens stored per teamId in the TokenModel collection
   • 🔍 Each request reads the JWT from the cookie to find the user/team
   • 💬 Messages are sent using that team’s Slack token

⏰ Scheduled Task Handling
   • 🔄 Scheduler polls the database every SCHEDULER_POLL_MS
   • 📬 Picks all due messages and sends them via the Slack API
   • ✅ Updates status to "sent" if delivered
   • ♻ If failed — retries with backoff until sent successfully

🧠 Challenges & Learnings

   • Deploying the backend was initially challenging due to confusion 
   around configuring environment variables. I experimented with 
   different combinations to identify the most appropriate and 
   functional setup.

   • The next hurdle was connecting the database to the backend. I 
   learned that only trusted IPs can access the database, so I updated 
   MongoDB’s settings to include the backend’s IP addresses, which 
   resolved the issue.
